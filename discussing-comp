Discussing Comp
Conversations around comp should ideally happen in two or three places during a interview process:

Initial screen
During the initial recruiter screen, comp is confirmed. The person doing a screen should already know what an upper/lower boundary is for compensation for the role.

They should end the call (see here) asking the candidate what their salary expectations are:

“Have you given any thought to what sort of salary you’d need to see in order for you next role to make sense for you?”

If you have properly built rapport during this call, the candidate will be forthcoming with you about their current compensation and what they’d need to see.

If they counter and instead ask for a range, also be forthcoming, but share compensation that is the middle middle of the range that you discussed. Always follow up this with a question, “How does that compare to your expectations?”. If there is a hesitancy on their end, confirm again, “Knowing that this is what we’re targeting, how would that affect your decision to move forward with the interview process?” If there is an objection to our comp, we want to isolate it so we can either: address it in the moment or get ahead of it (i.e. bringing the information back to the HM, HR, or any other stakeholders so we understand that percentage of candidates are being eliminated by our comp expectations).

The goal for this entire conversation is to feel really natural. People get very uncomfortable discussing money, and I tend to slightly overemphasize nonchalance during this part of the call, leaving it towards the end and bringing it up as almost an afterthought, in order to help make it feel easier to discuss.
