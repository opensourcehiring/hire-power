Hiring Plan
What is a Hiring Plan?

The Hiring Plan is the backbone of the hiring process and the single source of truth for each role.

The hiring plan defines the business outcomes we plan to achieve by hiring for the role, the competencies required to achieve the business outcomes, and the interview process to assess whether candidates have the required competencies.

It is a living document, and as changes are made through the interview process, they must be reflected in the hiring plan before they are pushed to your ATS.

Who is the DRI? The Hiring Manager, though recruiting should be heavily involved and consulted during its creation.
